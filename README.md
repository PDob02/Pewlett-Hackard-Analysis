# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

Overview of the analysis: In this analysis we were tasked with identifying retiring employees from a very large company that could participate in a part-time mentorship program before fully retiring. We analyzed things like their employee number, birth date, retirement date and names. We ultiamtely identifies around 1550 candidates eligble for the mentorship program. Most are in senior positions in the company. 
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

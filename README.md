# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

### Overview of the analysis: ### 
In this analysis we were tasked with identifying retiring employees from a very large company that could participate in a part-time mentorship program before fully retiring. We analyzed things like their employee number, birth date, retirement date and names. We ultimately identifies 1549 candidates eligble for the mentorship program. Most are in senior positions in the company. 


**Results**:

- We were able to identify 1549 candidates eligible for the mentorship program rollout
- This will help the company withstand Senior employees leaving for retirement and facilitate the knowledge transfer that is necessary for ongoing operations
- We were able to group employees by the 7 distinct tiles that they have within our orginization:

-The largest dearth of talent by role is our Senior Engineers & Senior Staff. This will be the largest replacement. Also, our third largest, Engineers, are in the same category as the Senior Engineers so that type of recruitment wil be essential moving forward.

Summary: There are over 72,000 retiring employees. Of that count, we have identified around 1549 employees that we can offer mentorship programs to. This is a very small ratio (only ~2%) and we will need to recruit Engineers to replace our existing staff. Even if this is offered to all 1549 candidates, some will not take it and just retire since they are of age. This will be a drain on our overall talent pool and knowledge transfer. We will need to aggresively recruit new engineering talent from outside of the organization.
